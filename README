Net::EMI

This module implements a client Interface to the EMI (External Machine Interface) specification,
which itself is based on the ERMES UCP (UNIVERSAL Computer Protocol) with some SMSC-specific
extensions.
It can be used to compose, send, receive, deliver... short messages to GSM Networks via
EMI-enabled SMSC's (Short Message Service Center).
Usually the Network connection is based on TCP/IP or X.25.
The EMI/UCP specification can be found as http://cpa.telenor.no/docs/SMSC_EMI_specification_3.5.pdf


WARNING!

With the release of version 1.0, the method interface was drastically changed.
Do not just install V1.0 over an older version and hope that your existing application(s)
will continue to work as before.

Yes, all versions before V1.0 were marked as BETA releases. From this version, V1.0,
we will try not to make any changes that will brake the backwards compatibility any more.
