Net::EMI

This module implements a client Interface to the EMI (External Machine Interface) specification,
which itself is based on the ERMES UCP (UNIVERSAL Computer Protocol) with some SMSC-specific
extensions.
It can be used to compose, send, receive, deliver... short messages to GSM Networks via 
EMI-enabled SMSC's (Short Message Service Center).
Usually the Network connection is based on TCP/IP or X.25.
The EMI/UCP specification can be found here http://cpa.telenor.no/docs/SMSC_EMI_specification_3.5.pdf
